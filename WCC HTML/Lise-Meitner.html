        <p>
            Lise Meitner was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who worked on radioactivity and nuclear physics. Otto Hahn and Meitner led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium. This process is the basis of the nuclear weapons that were developed in the U.S. during World War II and used against Japan in 1945. Nuclear fission is also the process exploited by nuclear reactors to generate electricity.

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Meitner went to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t in Berlin where famous physicist Max Planck allowed her to attend his lectures. She later became his assistant.
                </li>

                <li>
                    She was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany, teaching at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. She lost her position in the 1930s because of the anti-Jewish race laws of Nazi Germany.
                </li>

                <li>
                    She did not share in the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for nuclear fission that was awarded exclusively to her long-time collaborator Otto Hahn. Several scientists and journalists have called her exclusion "unjust."
                </li>

                <li>
                    Chemical element 109 has been named Meitnerium in her honor.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Albert Einstein praised her as the German Marie Curie.
